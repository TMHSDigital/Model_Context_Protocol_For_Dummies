## Monday.com API & MCP Server Mapping

### Core API Structure and Objects

Monday.com's platform API is built on GraphQL, offering flexibility in querying only the data needed for specific operations. The API provides access to core objects essential for project management functionality:

- **Boards**: The fundamental containers for projects and workflows that organize items into groups
- **Items**: The basic units of work within boards (tasks, projects, deliverables) that contain column values
- **Columns**: Various data fields attached to items (status, person, date, etc.)
- **Updates**: Comments and activity logs associated with items
- **Users**: Team members who can be assigned to items

Monday.com enforces several API rate limits to ensure system reliability, including complexity limits for query weight, daily call limits based on subscription tier, minute rate limits, concurrency limits, and IP-based limits. These limitations would need to be carefully managed when designing an MCP server to avoid disruptions in service.

### Mapping to MCP Resources

MCP Resources function as read-only data sources that an AI model can access without causing side effects. For a Monday.com MCP server, potential resources could include:

1. **Board Resources**:
   - `get_board_structure` - Retrieves column configurations and group layouts
   - `list_boards` - Returns available boards with metadata
   - `get_board_activity` - Provides recent updates and changes to a board
   
2. **Item Resources**:
   - `get_item_details` - Retrieves comprehensive information about specific items
   - `list_items_by_board` - Returns all items within a specific board
   - `list_items_by_status` - Returns items filtered by status values
   - `list_items_by_person` - Returns items assigned to specific team members
   - `list_overdue_items` - Returns items past their due dates

3. **User Resources**:
   - `get_user_details` - Retrieves information about team members
   - `get_user_workload` - Shows task distribution across team members

These resources would translate Monday.com's GraphQL responses into standardized formats accessible through the MCP protocol's JSON-RPC interface.

### Defining Monday.com Actions as MCP Tools

MCP Tools are callable functions that can perform actions and trigger side effects. These would map to Monday.com's mutation operations:

1. **Item Management Tools**:
   - `create_item` (params: board_id, group_id, item_name, column_values)
   - `update_item_status` (params: item_id, status_column_id, new_status)
   - `move_item_to_group` (params: item_id, target_group_id)
   - `delete_item` (params: item_id)

2. **Assignment and Collaboration Tools**:
   - `assign_user_to_item` (params: item_id, user_id)
   - `add_update_to_item` (params: item_id, update_text)
   - `create_subitem` (params: parent_item_id, subitem_name, column_values)

3. **Board Management Tools**:
   - `create_board` (params: board_name, template_id)
   - `add_user_to_board` (params: board_id, user_id)
   - `create_group` (params: board_id, group_name)

The standard MCP tool call format would apply, with requests following the JSON-RPC structure:

```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "create_item",
    "arguments": {
      "board_id": 1234567890,
      "group_id": "topics",
      "item_name": "Implement MCP integration",
      "column_values": {
        "status": "Working on it",
        "date": "2025-06-01",
        "person": "12345"
      }
    }
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

### MCP Prompts for Project Management Workflows

MCP Prompts enable standardized multi-step workflows. For Monday.com, these could include:

1. **Project Initiation Workflow**:
   - Creating a board from template
   - Setting up initial tasks with dependencies
   - Assigning team roles and responsibilities

2. **Sprint Planning Workflow**:
   - Moving backlog items to current sprint
   - Assigning time estimates
   - Setting priorities and deadlines

3. **Risk Management Workflow**:
   - Identifying tasks at risk based on progress
   - Creating escalation items
   - Notifying stakeholders via updates

## Technical Implementation of a Monday.com MCP Server

### Recommended Technology Stack

For implementing a Monday.com MCP server, a modern web technology stack would be appropriate:

1. **Backend Framework Options**:
   - Node.js with Express - Good for handling asynchronous API calls
   - Python with FastAPI - Offers strong typing and automatic documentation
   - Ruby on Rails - Integrates well with GraphQL clients

2. **Required Components**:
   - GraphQL client library to communicate with Monday.com API
   - JSON-RPC 2.0 implementation for MCP protocol conformance
   - Authentication management for OAuth 2.0
   - Rate limiting and caching layer to handle Monday.com API constraints

### Authentication and Security Architecture

The MCP server would need to implement OAuth 2.0 authentication with Monday.com:

1. The MCP server would store OAuth credentials securely (client ID, client secret)
2. Users would authenticate through Monday.com's OAuth flow
3. The MCP server would securely store and refresh access tokens
4. All API calls to Monday.com would include the appropriate authentication headers

This approach maintains security while allowing the MCP client (and by extension, AI models) to interact with Monday.com without direct access to credentials.

### Managing API Rate Limits

The Monday.com API enforces several types of rate limits that an MCP server must respect:

1. **Complexity Budget**: The server should optimize queries to request only necessary data and avoid deeply nested queries.

2. **Daily Call Limits**: The server should implement a token bucket system to track usage against different subscription tiers (Free: 200 calls, Basic/Standard: 1,000 calls, Pro: 10,000 calls, Enterprise: 25,000 calls).

3. **Minute Rate Limit**: Implementation of exponential backoff and respecting the Retry-After header when rate limited.

4. **Concurrency Limit**: Queuing mechanisms to limit parallel requests to Monday.com.

5. **IP Limit**: Distribution of requests across multiple IPs for high-volume scenarios.

Best practices include caching frequently accessed data to reduce API calls and implementing intelligent retry strategies that respect the retry_in_seconds field in error responses.

### Handling Monday.com's Flexible Data Structures

Monday.com's flexible board configurations present a challenge for standardized MCP resources. The server would need to:

1. Implement a schema mapping layer that translates between Monday.com's dynamic structures and standardized MCP schemas
2. Cache board structure definitions to understand the semantic meaning of columns
3. Provide metadata in resource responses to help AI models understand the context and meaning of returned data

1. **AI Automations**: Including actions like assigning labels, summarizing text, improving text, extracting information, writing with AI, detecting sentiment, and translating text.

2. **AI Blocks**: Column-specific AI capabilities integrated into boards.

These native capabilities provide basic AI functionality but lack the comprehensive reasoning and contextual understanding that an MCP integration with advanced AI models could provide.

### Advantages of an MCP-Based Approach

The Model Context Protocol offers several advantages over custom integrations:

1. **Standardization**: Using MCP creates a consistent interface that works across multiple AI models and applications.

2. **Extensibility**: The same MCP server could be used by different AI assistants and tools without modification.

3. **Contextual Awareness**: MCP allows AI systems to maintain context as they move between different tools and datasets.

4. **Reduced Integration Complexity**: Following MCP transforms the M×N integration problem (M apps × N data sources) into an M+N problem by standardizing the connection protocol.
