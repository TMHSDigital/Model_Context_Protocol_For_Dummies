# Images Directory

This directory is intended to store visual assets for the MCP For Dummies repository.

## Required Images

Please add the following images:

1. **mcp-banner.png** - A banner image for the repository, ideally showing the Model Context Protocol architecture with hosts, clients, and servers
   - Recommended size: 1200x630px
   - Should include "Model Context Protocol" text

You can create these images using design tools like Figma, Adobe Illustrator, or Canva.

Until a proper banner image is added, the repository README will display a placeholder image.
